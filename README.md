BOSH gas sensor connceted to the STM32 microcontroler via "Termite" application.
This work deals with the BOSH sensor and how to program and use it in a safe environment. For this project we will use the STM32Cube IDE. STM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debugging functions for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. We will use the hyperterminal "Termite" to read our data from the sensors. We will be able to read the data from the LCD screen that is connected to the microcontroller. We will be connecting the BOSH bme 680 gas sensor.
The gas sensor can also obtain temperature and humidity information from air pressure.
